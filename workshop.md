# Effective SSH usage for Pentesters

This is a beginner level session to train you into using `SSH` more effectively.

While pentesters may benefit (especially if they are planning on doing a time based exam like OSCP), this should be useful for anyone who has a need to login to servers using a `Secure SHell`.

> OpenSSH is an opensource implmentation of the SSH protocol

## Getting Started

### Login to the server

You need the following four things

1. SSH Client software
2. Username that you are trying to login as
3. Hostname/IP address of that server
4. Password of the username you are trying to login as

To access the servers you will need the following

| Name of the host |   IP Adress   |
| :--------------: | :-----------: |
|   sshserver100   | 192.168.1.100 |
|   sshserver200   | 192.168.1.200 |

### About lack of password security

> For the duration of this workshop, the password for all users are `passpass`. This is just to ensure that we don't waste in any time in trying to remember the passwords.

### Important to note

> Also if a command says `user`, you need to substitute it with your first name in lower case.

### With the above pieces in place

### SSH Login

```bash
ssh <USERNAME>@<HOSTNAME/IP>
```

> Try now

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.100
```

```bash
user@192.168.1.100's password:
```

### Providing a different user

Try giving the username with `-l` flag

```bash
ssh -l <USERNAME> host/ip
```

### Providing a different port

What if SSH service is not listening on the standard ports?

```bash
ssh -l akash -p 2222 192.168.1.200
```

### Executing the command and capturing the output

```bash
ssh akash@192.168.1.100 ls -ltra
```

#### Try out the following commands and capture the output for both the servers

- `id`
- `ifconfig`
- `netstat -nltup`
- `ps aux`
- `iptables -L`

## Becoming Productive

We realise quickly that typing the password so many times means that we can't automate and script things. And it is boring! So now we will do two things to make us really productive

1. Use a configuration file to maintain how we want to use our SSH commands
2. Add an identity file for public/private key authentication

### Using a configuration file

A default configuration file can be created in `~/.ssh/config` path.

> For this workshop we will not mess with that.

Make a new directory `effective-ssh-usage-for-pentesters` in your laptop.

```bash
mkdir effective-ssh-usage-for-pentesters
cd effective-ssh-usage-for-pentesters
```

Open your favourite text editor and create a new file called `null-puliya-ssh-config`

This is a simple text file. Configurations can be on a per-host basis.

#### Lets add a new host

`Host server100`

While it is not required, convention is to indent the various server blocks.

#### Add a hostname or ip address for that host

    Host server100
        Hostname 192.168.1.100

#### Add a username

    Host server100
        Hostname 192.168.1.100
        User user

#### We can add two more useful configurations

Primarily to ensure that our connection stays alive for long we can add the following two configuration options

- `ServerAliveInterval 30`
- `ServerAliveCountMax 10`

If you want to understand what these two do and also look up more options `man 5 ssh_config`

#### Final output

    Host server100
        Hostname 192.168.1.100
        User akash
        ServerAliveInterval 30
        ServerAliveCountMax 10

#### Using our custom config file

```bash
ssh -F null-puliya-ssh-config server100
```

> This is exactly where we were when we started.

If you wanted to add the options to the original command line this is what the command would look like

```bash
ssh -l user 192.168.1.100 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=10
```

#### Five minutes to go over other configuration options

For SSH clients

```bash
man 5 ssh_config
```

For SSH server

```bash
man 5 sshd_config
```

### Using an identity file

#### Generating a public/private key pair

Many options. For today we will do the following ones

1. RSA
2. Twisted Edwards Curve

> DSA is not recommended anymore. So is a RSA keysize smaller than 4096

##### RSA (Older way, but more compatible)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

> Pay attention to the output

```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/path/to/home/dir/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

For now we don't want to save in the default place so give it a descriptive name.

`server100rsa`

```bash
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

> For the duration of this workshop, the phasephrases for all identities are `passpass`. This is just to ensure that we don't waste in any time in trying to remember the passwords.

Two files will be generated.

`server100rsa.pub` and `server100rsa`

If you don't want the public key to leak your laptop username and hostname use this command

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "null-puliya"
```

##### Ed25519 (What you should be using)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f server100ed -Npasspass -C "null-puliya-ed25519"
```

| Flags | Comment                                                   |
| :---: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t`  | Type of key for identity                                  |
| `-f`  | File name of the identity key pair                        |
| `-N`  | Passphrase that will secure the secret key                |
| `-C`  | Comment which is added to the public part of the key pair |

Two files will be generated.

`server100ed.pub` and `server100ed`

#### How do we use this identity to login passwordlessly

Two steps need to happen

| Step | Remark                                                                                 |
| :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | We need to copy the `public` key file to the server                                    |
|  2   | We need to use the `private` key file when we try to login to the server, after step 1 |

##### Step 1

See if you have the following command in your client

`ssh-copy-id` if yes then this command

```bash
ssh-copy-id -n -i server100ed.pub user@192.168.1.100
```

This is a dry run. Shows you exactly what will be copied.
If we are happy run the command without `-n`.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i server100ed.pub user@192.168.1.100
```

> Any one who didn't get that command? I will demonstrate the other way of copying

##### Step 2

Now that we have copied our public part of the key pair successfully how do we use it?

In a command

```bash
ssh -l akash -i server100ed 192.168.1.100
```

```bash
Enter passphrase for key 'server100ed':
```

Logged in

Update `null-puliya-ssh-config` file to include two new directives

Host server100
Hostname 192.168.1.100
User akash
ServerAliveInterval 30
IdentityFile server100ed
IdentitiesOnly yes

Now lets try

```bash
ssh -F null-puliya-ssh-config sshserver100
```

> We just traded entering our password every time with now having to enter a passphrase every time!! #@#$@#$!!!!

Lets make sure that this time when we enter the passphrase our SSH client remembers this till we reboot the laptop. This is done using an `SSH agent`

```bash
ssh-add `pwd`/server100ed
```

To list all the added identities

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

To delete an identity so that we get asked for the passphrase again

```bash
ssh-add -d `pwd`/server100.pub
```

Try to login to the server now

```bash
ssh akash@192.168.1.100
```

Or with config file

```bash
ssh -F config null-puliya-ssh-config sshserver100
```

## Becoming effective

Being able to use config files to login to SSH servers with the appropriate identities, per host configurations etc. is just the starting point of becoming effective.

The following kinds of activities become simple once you have the basics in place

1. Secure copy of files and folders to and from servers
2. Using one server as a jump box to another server
3. Using a server as a SOCKS proxy to send all data through it

### Secure copying of files

Let us copy a folder from the server

```bash
scp -F null-puliya-ssh-config -r sshserver100:/usr/local/share/wordpress-files wordpress-files
```

```bash
scp <SSH-RELATED-CONFIG> -r <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>
```

We can always have source as local and destination on the server. We just need to ensure that we have adequate permission to write to the path we want to write to

Lets copy the `wordpress-files` to our home directory on the server

```bash
scp -F null-puliya-ssh-config -r wordpress-files sshserver100:.
```

Here `sshserver100:.` translates into user@HOST and the `.` after the colon translates into current directory.

> If you are confused, ask yourself this question. What is the directory I am in when I have just logged in to the server

### Using a computer as a jumpbox

```bash
ssh -t -F null-puliya-ssh-config -A sshserver100 ssh 192.168.1.200 -p 2222
```

Using the configuration file

    Host sshserver100
        Hostname 192.168.1.100
        User akash
        ServerAliveInterval 30
        ServerAliveCountMax 10
        IdentityFile server100ed
        IdentitiesOnly yes
    Host sshserver200
        Hostname 192.168.1.200
        #ProxyJump ssh akash@192.168.1.100:22
        ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p akash@192.168.1.100
        User akash
        Port 2222
        ServerAliveInterval 30
        ServerAliveCountMax 10

Now we can simply run this command

```bash
ssh -F null-puliya-ssh-config sshserver200
```

Did you notice we are being asked for the password for the second server. Remember `ssh-copy-id`

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i server100ed.pub akash@192.168.1.200 -p 2222
```

Now try again

```bash
ssh -F null-puliya-ssh-config sshserver200
```
